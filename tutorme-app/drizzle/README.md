# Drizzle migrations and introspect output

- **Migrations:** SQL files generated by `npm run drizzle:generate` live in timestamped subfolders. Apply them with `npm run drizzle:migrate` or `npx drizzle-kit migrate`.
- **Introspect:** After running `npm run drizzle:pull` (with DB up), generated `schema.ts` and `relations.ts` appear here. Copy or merge them into `src/lib/db/schema/` and update `src/lib/db/schema/index.ts` to export the real tables, then you can remove the placeholder table.
